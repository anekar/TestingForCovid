problems we need to clean the data.

```

to know key insigths of the data.

## Problems with the dataframe
   Cleaning the dataframe i came across with some problems
   1. New column names must be replace the old ones
   2. Unnecessary columns must be deleted
   3. The year_week column is not following the 3rd normality form and it has scientific notations
   4. The week variable must be inserted in a new column
