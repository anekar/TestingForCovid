# Project Info
```
The downloadable data files contain information about hospitalisation and
Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission rates and current occupancy for COVID-19
by date and country. 
Each row contains the corresponding data for a certain date (day or week) and per country.
```

## Collecting Data 
 The data have been collected from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control
 
## Cleaning Data
```
In order to detect anomalies, NA values, outliers and other 
problems we need to clean the data in order to make the dataframe tidy.

```
## Exploratory Data Analysis
```
To get a sense of the data a basic exploratory in the data is required, in order
to know key insigths of the data.
```

## Problems Faced
   Cleaning the dataframe i came across with some problems
   1. New column names must be replace the old ones
   2. Unnecessary columns must be deleted
   3. The year_week column is not following the 3rd normality form and it has scientific notations
   4. The week variable must be inserted in a new column
